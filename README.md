# Calculator App

Calculator App is a coding challenge I received from Sezzle.

The app's main function is for multiple users to be able to do calculations and send their results to each other in real-time.

Technologies I used to build this website:
<ul>
    <li>HTML</li>
    <li>SASS</li>
    <li>JavaScript</li>
    <li>Node.js</li>
    <li>Express</li>
    <li>Socket.io</li>
</ul>
