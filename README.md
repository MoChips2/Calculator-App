# Calculator App

Calculator App is a coding challenge I received from Sezzle.

The app's main function is for multiple users to be able to do calculations and send their results to each other in real-time.

Technologies I used to build this website:
<ul>
    <li>HTML</li>
    <li>SASS</li>
    <li>JavaScript</li>
    <li>Node.js</li>
    <li>Express</li>
    <li>Socket.io</li>
</ul>


To run this app, clone this githup repository and in your terminal run `npm install` to install required dependencies. Then type `npm start` to start the server, and go to "localhost: 3000" in your browser to run the site locally.

The deployed website is found here: https://powerful-headland-80959.herokuapp.com/
